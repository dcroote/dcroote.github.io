<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting the site. You can find social profiles, project links, and flavors of my bio below. </p>

<h2>Contact</h2>

Feel free to email me directly at first initial last name at gmail.

<h2>Summary Bio</h2>

<p>I am an action-oriented biotech executive, entrepreneur, and technical leader with responsibilities spanning management, corporate strategy, intellectual property, scientific communication, technology development, basic research, and software engineering, including bioinformatic pipeline development and AI implementations.

<p>In my current role as co-founder and Chief Technical Officer of <a href="https://iggenix.com" target="_blank">IgGenix</a>, I am developing transformative therapies for individuals suffering from allergies. Our peanut allergy therapeutic, IGNX001, completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in November 2025. I wrote about the <a href="/2024/08/22/accelerate-website.html">study launch here.</a></p>

<h2>Speaker Bio</h2>

<p>Dr. Croote is the co-founder and chief technical officer of clinical-stage antibody therapeutics company IgGenix, which was spun out of Stanford University with exclusively licensed intellectual property developed by Dr. Croote while in the laboratory of Dr. Stephen Quake. Dr. Croote has experience applying mass spectrometry, single-cell transcriptomics, next-generation sequencing, bioinformatics, and antibody engineering to better understand a diverse set of diseases and immunological perturbations including food allergies, flu vaccination, dengue infection, and glioblastoma. He is the lead author of a publication in the peer-reviewed journal Science that describes the first characterization of single human IgE-producing B cells and their allergen-specific antibodies. He received his B.S. from Brown University and Ph.D. from Stanford University where he was a National Science Foundation and Stanford Graduate fellow.</p>
