I have a cheap garlic press, which means that after each use garlic is stuck in seemingly every one of its 63 holes. The faucet water pressure is insufficient to free the garlic and I am left with the unsatisfactory process of poking garlic free with a toothpick. This is obviously an irritating problem that needs solving. 

## Potential solutions

1. Buy a better-designed garlic press in less than a minute online and have it show up in a day or two. This is the optimal solution, except perhaps if you consider the waste generated by discarding the old garlic press and the costs of shipping and delivering the new product. This solution is also not very fun.

2. Design and 3D print a garlic press cleaner. This was the clear choice.

## CAD model

This is a simple design consisting of an extruded base and an array of posts (extruded circles). The full model is [available on  Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/cb2f7780bde13603780e855c/w/8bb77d57f5a67c7b4d3e95ad/e/037f1c0159a5ebba17e23b8f), which is free to use online if you don't mind your designs being public.

## Outcome

The final product, after going through a couple of iterations to fix the post spacing and diameter, can be seen below. It clears all of the garlic in a single poke, meaning I have realized a 63X improvement in cleaning speed. Time well spent.
