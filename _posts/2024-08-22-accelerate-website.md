It feels somewhat silly that launching a website imparts such a strong feeling of progress, but it does. For years, scientists and investors have been the audience for updates. A website changes that. As an interface to the public, it's a transition. Preclinical to clinical. It's of course still the beginning. But it's a new beginning. And I couldn't be more proud of the team: <a href="https://iggenix.com/pressreleases/iggenix-announces-first-patient-dosed-in-phase-1-clinical-trial-accelerate-peanut-evaluating-ignx001-in-peanut-allergy/">ACCELERATE Peanut Study</a>.
