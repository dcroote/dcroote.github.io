The best products are built by those who have the need themselves, and this is one very personal example.

I was solving for my need to deeply understand clinical trials in a rare disease.

I wanted to track specific trials. I wanted notifications when trials changed, and succinct summaries of those changes. I wanted to know when new trials launched. I wanted enrollment rates, breakdowns of trials by phase, sponsor, intervention, and more. I wanted filters that updated visualizations in real time. I wanted maps, aggregated trial site data, and top enrolling sites. And I wanted a beautiful user interface in which to do it all (no offense clinicaltrials dot gov).

So I built it. Introducing, Trial Inference!
