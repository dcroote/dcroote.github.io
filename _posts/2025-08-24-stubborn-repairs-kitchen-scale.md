Stories of problem solving, often with an attempt at humor.

Based on not-so-subtle Amazon reviews, many people use the small scale I own to weigh a particular elicit substance.

Not so for me! My drug of choice is caffeine delivered via coffee, [as I've described](/2020/05/09/cold-brew.html). My wife fondly calls it “life blood” and the scale is an essential component to the makings of a perfect cup of east African light roast.

Naturally then, panic struck when the scale didn't turn on one morning.

Dead batteries is always guess #1, but even with a fresh pair it wouldn't turn on.

My wife began to search online for a new husband<sup>1</sup> while I considered our options. Prime same-day wouldn't get here that morning. I don't have time to drive to blue bottle. Should I just eyeball the amount of coffee? I've been weighing 46.6 grams of whole beans every morning for years straight, so one would hope I'd get decently close.<sup>2</sup>

But before submitting to the undoubtedly disastrous brew that would have resulted from even a few hundred milligrams of difference to the target amount, I took one more look at the scale.

Inspecting carefully, I noticed one of the battery contacts had fouled. Some quick sanding later and it was alive. Crisis averted.

<li>She did not, but I found this addition funny. In reality she's incredible and testament to that is putting up with nonsense such as this.</li>
<li>This would be an interesting experiment actually, me vs other people who don't do this daily competing for the minimum mean +/- std dev of absolute difference to 46.6g across N trials using sight alone.</li>
