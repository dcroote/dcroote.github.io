Artificial intelligence is evolving in seemingly contradictory directions because it's simultaneously:

Feared <sup>1</sup><br />
Celebrated <sup>2</sup>

Expensive <sup>3</sup><br />
Inexpensive <sup>4</sup>

Specialized <sup>5</sup><br />
General <sup>6</sup>

Larger <sup>7</sup><br />
Smaller <sup>8</sup>

Isolated <sup>9</sup><br />
Connected <sup>10</sup>

Regulated <sup>11</sup><br />
Open <sup>12</sup>

Structured <sup>13</sup><br />
Creative <sup>14</sup>

Perhaps, one day, AI will even be a lens through which we understand the beauty of intelligence. Or not? Predicting the future turns out to be pretty hard, but technological progress is incredibly exciting nonetheless.
