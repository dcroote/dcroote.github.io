<ol style="font-size: 0.9em">
<li>the new nuclear, hopefully with an outcome where society actually benefits this time</li>
<li>early, but still a remarkable human achievement, and built from sand (silicon) no less</li>
<li>the frontier model arms race isn't slowing</li>
<li>for inference, the user hopes</li>
<li>routers + fine-tuned agents? My drug discovery AI might ask my toxicology, CMC, and preclinical AIs for molecule feedback while my commercial AI evaluates the market and my clinical and regulatory AIs work on a clinical development plan. But we're a long way off.</li>
<li>multimodal. For example, I can't draw, but was able to <a href="/2023/12/10/childrens-book.html">illustrate a children's book</a> from natural language using generative AI.</li>
<li>well, it is the first L</li>
<li>to run on smartphones? Edge something something?</li>
<li>with proprietary data</li>
